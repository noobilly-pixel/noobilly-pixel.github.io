    <h2>Project Summary</h2>
    <p><strong>KIRBY AND ADEN PAULE VERSUS THE WATER ROAMERS</strong></p>
    <p>To fully understand the lore of THE ALLIES, I've added this project that was made a year ago. Pollution is a very big problem, so Kirby went to Jeaut-Paulia to fight the king of the water roamers, who are the people who pollute. To ask for directions, Kirby went to Carol Paule. Then Kirby went to Maester Paule to get a book to fully understand pollution. For the battle to be easier, Kirby went to Farmer Paule to get some food. So then Kirby meets Aden Paule near the exit of the "Lost Sacred Land Of Water Roamers". After arriving, Aden Paule puts down his backpack and both of them get ready for battle. The battle was harsh, but they've won it. So then with their arrival with a yacht, they meet the historian Samuel Paule who has written the history of every battle that has happened in Jeaut-Paulia. And so then does the tides change and the world is in peace!</p>

    <p><strong>BOOK 1 in THE ALLIES:</strong> Earthworm Sally has lost her parents, and she's trying to win a gameshow hosted by Kacy with contestants: Coca Cola can, Noobilly, Bacon Hair, Shrek, and Earthworm Sally herself. She hasn't won the gameshow, so she got mad and challenged Kacy to a fight. Thanks to Kacy's hacking aids, she has won. Earthworm Sally was astonished by her strength and decided to ask Kacy to help her with the fight happening in Jeaut-Paulia, to fight the big storm. The other contestants have agreed, including Kacy. What will happen next? Find out in BOOK 2.</p>

    <p><strong>BOOK 2 in THE ALLIES: MUSIC</strong></p>
    <p>Now our heroes will go fight the storm. You know, how about letting Aden Paule tell you about this. Here is Aden Paule's text, oh and by the way he is addressing this to Earthworm Sally: When you came to Jeaut-Paulia, the adventure began. Earthworm Sally and Coca Cola Can took to the skies in a plane, while Noobilly and his grandpa sailed in on a boat. Kacy and Bacon Hair flew, thanks to their trusty hacks. Once they landed, they discovered Maester Paule’s books, and there it was—the secret: music, the storm’s great weakness. The battle against the storm was fierce. But in a twist of fate, everyone except Sally was pulled into a black hole, thrown back to Jeaut-Paulia. Kacy and Bacon Hair, though, hacked their way back, only to be banned instantly. Sally, now armed with a saber, faced the storm alone, until the spirit of Aden Paule rose to her side, lending strength. Kacy, ever the hacker, unbanned herself just in time to come to Sally's rescue. In that moment, Sally awakened her ultimate form. Together, they fought with all their might, and in a single, decisive strike—boom—the storm was no more. Sally, you are powerful and unstoppable.</p>
    <p><em>THE END –Samuel Paule</em></p>
