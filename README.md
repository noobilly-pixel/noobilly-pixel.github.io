        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello, I'm Noobilly, or Mahdi in real life. I'm just a student at school who loves making projects. This website is about my 'projects'! My key skills include not only being very smart but also being great at brainstorming, so I can generate project ideas quickly.</p>
        <p>Some of the projects I've completed include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A long adventure-style game about pollution that is both informative and entertaining!</li>
            <li>A cool project with an informative section and a fun quiz at the end.</li>
            <li>A project full of memes that I shared with everyone on September 25th, 2024.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>My project ideas are few for now, but here are a couple of them:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A project about music—something very important to me!</li>
            <li>A project about geography, focusing on countries and their histories.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I don't have too many project ideas yet, but as soon as I do, this website will be updated to reflect them.</p>
