Noobilly wanted to sacrifice a Kayatron [Kayatron: an endangered species, which the last one alive is Kacy—or is it only Kacy??]. To gain hacks and keep Kacy alive, they needed to find a rowing of a boat, which the 55th number knows the answer to. But to find the 55th number, they had to pass 3 trials: the trial of unity, the trial of strength, and the trial of sacrifice.</p>

Project Summary
KIRBY AND ADEN PAULE VERSUS THE WATER ROAMERS

To fully understand the lore of THE ALLIES, I've added this project that was made a year ago. Pollution is a very big problem, so Kirby went to Jeaut-Paulia to fight the king of the water roamers, who are the people who pollute. To ask for directions, Kirby went to Carol Paule. Then Kirby went to Maester Paule to get a book to fully understand pollution. For the battle to be easier, Kirby went to Farmer Paule to get some food. So then Kirby meets Aden Paule near the exit of the "Lost Sacred Land Of Water Roamers". After arriving, Aden Paule puts down his backpack and both of them get ready for battle. The battle was harsh, but they've won it. So then with their arrival with a yacht, they meet the historian Samuel Paule who has written the history of every battle that has happened in Jeaut-Paulia. And so then does the tides change and the world is in peace!

<p><strong>BOOK 1 in THE ALLIES:</strong> Earthworm Sally has lost her parents, and she's trying to win a gameshow hosted by Kacy with contestants: Coca Cola can, Noobilly, Bacon Hair, Shrek, and Earthworm Sally herself. She hasn't won the gameshow, so she got mad and challenged Kacy to a fight. Thanks to Kacy's hacking aids, she has won. Earthworm Sally was astonished by her strength and decided to ask Kacy to help her with the fight happening in Jeaut-Paulia, to fight the big storm. The other contestants have agreed, including Kacy. What will happen next? Find out in BOOK 2.</p>

<p><strong>BOOK 2 in THE ALLIES: MUSIC</strong></p>
<p>Now our heroes will go fight the storm. You know, how about letting Aden Paule tell you about this. Here is Aden Paule's text, oh and by the way he is addressing this to Earthworm Sally: When you came to Jeaut-Paulia, the adventure began. Earthworm Sally and Coca Cola Can took to the skies in a plane, while Noobilly and his grandpa sailed in on a boat. Kacy and Bacon Hair flew, thanks to their trusty hacks. Once they landed, they discovered Maester Paule’s books, and there it was—the secret: music, the storm’s great weakness. The battle against the storm was fierce. But in a twist of fate, everyone except Sally was pulled into a black hole, thrown back to Jeaut-Paulia. Kacy and Bacon Hair, though, hacked their way back, only to be banned instantly. Sally, now armed with a saber, faced the storm alone, until the spirit of Aden Paule rose to her side, lending strength. Kacy, ever the hacker, unbanned herself just in time to come to Sally's rescue. In that moment, Sally awakened her ultimate form. Together, they fought with all their might, and in a single, decisive strike—boom—the storm was no more. Sally, you are powerful and unstoppable.</p>
<p><em>THE END –Samuel Paule</em></p>

<p><strong>EPISODE 6 in THE ALLIES: SALLY THE IIND-ORIGINS:</strong> The Forgotten Echoes of Eshmir
A journey into the unknown. A land that defies time. A legend that refuses to be forgotten.

Chapter 1: A Story of the Past
Kacy asks Sally for a tale, and she tells the story of her grandfather, Sally the IIND. He once embarked on an expedition with Saaida Al-Hmounia, a brilliant explorer obsessed with the ever-shifting plateau of Eshmir. Legends spoke of a monolith within Eshmir that distorted time and space—an anomaly no map could ever capture. With journal in hand, Sally the IIND recorded every strange occurrence as they ventured deeper into the unknown.

Chapter 2: A World That Changes
As they traversed Eshmir’s unstable terrain, reality itself seemed to bend:
Rocks hovered in the air before settling.
Water flowed in reverse.
Landmarks moved when unobserved.
Saaida attempted to rationalize it—unstable fault lines, magnetic anomalies—but the deeper they went, the more their senses betrayed them. Their maps became useless. Their footprints disappeared. Then, at last, they found it—the monolith. A massive, humming structure that distorted everything around it.

Chapter 3: Science vs. the Impossible
The closer they got, the more the world unraveled. Compasses spun out of control. Voices echoed incorrectly. Saaida placed markers to track their movements—yet, when they turned back, the markers were gone. The truth dawned on them: Eshmir wasn’t shifting. Eshmir was alive.
Saaida touched the monolith, and reality itself cracked apart. The world shimmered, distorted—and they fell.

Chapter 4: The Monolith’s Curse
When they awoke, everything looked the same. But something was wrong. The sky was a different shade. Their footprints from before were missing. Had they traveled through time? Had the monolith transported them?
Then, Saaida changed. Her movements slowed, her voice delayed. She whispered, "I don’t think this is our world anymore."
And then, in the distance, footsteps. They were not alone.

Chapter 5: The Eternal Trap
Sally the IIND realized the truth: the monolith had pulled them into an altered version of reality. Eshmir was not just a place—it was a sentient trap. And Saaida… she was becoming part of it. He ran, reaching for the monolith one last time—
Then, everything went black.
When he awoke, she was gone.
His final journal entry read: "If you find this, do not trust your eyes. Eshmir is never what it seems."

Chapter 6: The Cycle Repeats
Years later, Sally and the modern-day Saaida followed his grandfather’s path. They found the monolith. They touched it.
And they woke up in a world that looked the same but felt wrong. Had they escaped? Or had Eshmir simply tricked them into believing they had?
As they walked away, a tree in the distance shifted.
Then the sun flickered.
The illusion remained.

Post-Credit Twist: The Final Glitch
Descending the plateau, Sally noticed something terrifying—
A set of footprints.
Not theirs.
Circling endlessly.
Saaida gasped. Buried beneath the dirt was a journal—old, battered, barely legible. On the cover, in shaky handwriting:
Sally the IIND.
If he had left it behind… that meant one thing:
He never made it out.
BLACK SCREEN.
THE END…?</p>

You must create them, if you want to participate, before the trivia event. </em></p>

  <h3>I. HANDMADE ARTS:</h3>
  <p><em>[My introduction]</em></p>
  <p>Handmade arts involve creating objects using manual skills and creativity, often without the use of large machinery. This includes a variety of forms such as textile arts (weaving, knitting, crocheting, embroidery, and quilting), ceramics and pottery (used to make mugs and other items), woodworking (lathe is a common tool), jewelry making (beading and wire wrapping), and paper crafts (origami and papercutting). Handmade arts allow for personal expression and the creation of unique items.</p>
  <p><em>If you have any questions feel free to ask me<</em></p>

  <h3>II. MUSIC</h3>
  <p><em>[My introduction]</em></p>
  <p>Music is fascinating too isn't it? From albums: (definition of albums: Albums are collections of songs that an artist or band creates to explore a theme, story, or mood. Each song (or "track") on the album can have its own vibe, but together, they form a complete experience. Think of it as a book with each track as a chapter. Some tracks might be upbeat and fun, while others are more emotional or reflective, creating a journey for the listener from start to finish.) (types of albums: Types of Albums:
Studio Album: A complete set of new, original songs recorded in a studio.
Live Album: Recordings of performances in front of an audience, capturing raw energy.
Compilation Album: Collections of songs from various sources, like hits or rare tracks.
EP (Extended Play): A short album with a few songs, longer than a single but shorter than a full album.
Soundtrack: Music specifically created for movies, TV shows, or games, often conveying mood and story.) (Biggest albums of 2024: in the picture)<img src="image.png" alt="Description of image" width="500">


. There are many artists with very popular tracks and albums. I did not say what tracks are? OH! Tracks are really the songs in an album and there are 2 types for tracks: Normal Tracks and Singles. Singles also have types unlike Normal Tracks: Types of Tracks:
Lead Single: The main song released to promote an album.
Title Track: A song that shares the album’s name and often reflects its theme.
Interlude: A short, sometimes instrumental piece that bridges parts of an album.
