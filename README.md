  <h2>Special Projects</h2>
  <h3>The Special Sally - A Unique Halloween Edition</h3>
  <p>This project takes you on an exclusive Halloween-themed journey, with Sally grappling with her own doubts and insecurities after a failed battle. It's not just about power but finding inner strength through the support of friends and mentors. Through eerie encounters and some spooky moments, Sally comes to understand that she doesn't need to prove herself to anyone. It’s an inspiring yet fun story made with special Halloween vibes—only available on my site and channel!</p>

  <h3>Row row, row your boat</h3>
  <p>Enjoy this project that shows the journey of Noobilly, Kacy, and Bacon Hair finding the 55th number and a rowing of a boat. Noobilly wanted to sacrifice a Kayatron [Kayatron: an endangered species, which the last one alive is Kacy—or is it only Kacy??]. To gain hacks and keep Kacy alive, they needed to find a rowing of a boat, which the 55th number knows the answer to. But to find the 55th number, they had to pass 3 trials: the trial of unity, the trial of strength, and the trial of sacrifice.</p>

Project Summary
KIRBY AND ADEN PAULE VERSUS THE WATER ROAMERS

To fully understand the lore of THE ALLIES, I've added this project that was made a year ago. Pollution is a very big problem, so Kirby went to Jeaut-Paulia to fight the king of the water roamers, who are the people who pollute. To ask for directions, Kirby went to Carol Paule. Then Kirby went to Maester Paule to get a book to fully understand pollution. For the battle to be easier, Kirby went to Farmer Paule to get some food. So then Kirby meets Aden Paule near the exit of the "Lost Sacred Land Of Water Roamers". After arriving, Aden Paule puts down his backpack and both of them get ready for battle. The battle was harsh, but they've won it. So then with their arrival with a yacht, they meet the historian Samuel Paule who has written the history of every battle that has happened in Jeaut-Paulia. And so then does the tides change and the world is in peace!

<p><strong>BOOK 1 in THE ALLIES:</strong> Earthworm Sally has lost her parents, and she's trying to win a gameshow hosted by Kacy with contestants: Coca Cola can, Noobilly, Bacon Hair, Shrek, and Earthworm Sally herself. She hasn't won the gameshow, so she got mad and challenged Kacy to a fight. Thanks to Kacy's hacking aids, she has won. Earthworm Sally was astonished by her strength and decided to ask Kacy to help her with the fight happening in Jeaut-Paulia, to fight the big storm. The other contestants have agreed, including Kacy. What will happen next? Find out in BOOK 2.</p>

<p><strong>BOOK 2 in THE ALLIES: MUSIC</strong></p>
<p>Now our heroes will go fight the storm. You know, how about letting Aden Paule tell you about this. Here is Aden Paule's text, oh and by the way he is addressing this to Earthworm Sally: When you came to Jeaut-Paulia, the adventure began. Earthworm Sally and Coca Cola Can took to the skies in a plane, while Noobilly and his grandpa sailed in on a boat. Kacy and Bacon Hair flew, thanks to their trusty hacks. Once they landed, they discovered Maester Paule’s books, and there it was—the secret: music, the storm’s great weakness. The battle against the storm was fierce. But in a twist of fate, everyone except Sally was pulled into a black hole, thrown back to Jeaut-Paulia. Kacy and Bacon Hair, though, hacked their way back, only to be banned instantly. Sally, now armed with a saber, faced the storm alone, until the spirit of Aden Paule rose to her side, lending strength. Kacy, ever the hacker, unbanned herself just in time to come to Sally's rescue. In that moment, Sally awakened her ultimate form. Together, they fought with all their might, and in a single, decisive strike—boom—the storm was no more. Sally, you are powerful and unstoppable.</p>
<p><em>THE END –Samuel Paule</em></p>

  <h2>EVENT - TRIVIA</h2>
  <p><em>Well hello! Welcome! So in here you will find all the information regarding the trivia that I've told you about. It will **most likely** be on January 15th. But it could also be the 17th. I will inform you on January 3rd when it will really be. To sum up, it will be a trivia-jeopard that will be based on points. I will ask you a series of questions that you will choose the points for, let me explain. There will be 11 categories: Handmade arts, music, sports, the allies, games, geography, history, general knowledge, listening/ reading and SALLYNO. You already know 6 of them, and 5 of them are some you already know about them. I will ask you to choose a point form: 100,200,300,400 or 500. From easiest to hardest (meaning 100 is easy, 200 medium as well as 300, 400 hard and 500 extreme). If you manage to answer a 100 points question you win the value, but if you fail to do so, you lose it. If you have any questions about this, feel free to ask me in my contacts or face to face at school. Yes, there will be a prize for the winner. You must create teams of 5 people (minimum 3 people).  You must create them, if you want to participate, before the trivia event. </em></p>

  <h3>I. HANDMADE ARTS:</h3>
  <p><em>[My introduction]</em></p>
  <p>Handmade arts involve creating objects using manual skills and creativity, often without the use of large machinery. This includes a variety of forms such as textile arts (weaving, knitting, crocheting, embroidery, and quilting), ceramics and pottery (used to make mugs and other items), woodworking (lathe is a common tool), jewelry making (beading and wire wrapping), and paper crafts (origami and papercutting). Handmade arts allow for personal expression and the creation of unique items.</p>
  <p><em>[My conclusion]</em></p>

  <h3>II. MUSIC</h3>
  <p><em>[My introduction]</em></p>
  <p>Music is the art of arranging sounds in time to create harmony, melody, and rhythm. It can be experienced in different formats such as studio albums, live albums, and extended plays (EPs). Tracks within albums can include singles, covers, and remixes. Notable albums of 2024 include <em>Short N’ Sweet</em> by Sabrina Carpenter and <em>Hit Me Hard and Soft</em> by Billie Eilish. Music can be listened to through streaming platforms, vinyl records, CDs, and live performances. Michael Jackson's <em>Thriller</em> remains one of the biggest albums of all time.</p>
