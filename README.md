  <h2>Special Projects</h2>
  <h3>The Special Sally - A Unique Halloween Edition</h3>
  <p>This project takes you on an exclusive Halloween-themed journey, with Sally grappling with her own doubts and insecurities after a failed battle. It's not just about power but finding inner strength through the support of friends and mentors. Through eerie encounters and some spooky moments, Sally comes to understand that she doesn't need to prove herself to anyone. It’s an inspiring yet fun story made with special Halloween vibes—only available on my site and channel!</p>

  <h3>Row row, row your boat</h3>
  <p>Enjoy this project that shows the journey of Noobilly, Kacy, and Bacon Hair finding the 55th number and a rowing of a boat. Noobilly wanted to sacrifice a Kayatron [Kayatron: an endangered species, which the last one alive is Kacy—or is it only Kacy??]. To gain hacks and keep Kacy alive, they needed to find a rowing of a boat, which the 55th number knows the answer to. But to find the 55th number, they had to pass 3 trials: the trial of unity, the trial of strength, and the trial of sacrifice.</p>
